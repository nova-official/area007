# Tramnet
The Tramnet project connects the entire global network and planetary network of Area 007. 

It connects hundreds of site through an advancted tram network (which the map is still being developed currently) and in most cases is the only entrance to the sites. This makes it severely more secure as the other option would be to guess where the site was, dig and make a even louder entrance into the site. Because of this, the Tram network being the only entrance is secure, including the addition of random checkpoints, no-knock tram raids and searches from security department personnel to. 

The Tramnet is also made of multiple different lines and has a fleet of trains and laid out tracks. It also goes into many different other non-area 007 sections and also can serve as a evacuation for civilians.

## Security Measures
The Tramnet will have multiple security measures from standard metal detector, keycards to open doors, 24 hour surveillance at stations and on the trams, doors logs and secure blast doors closing behind the trams.

Further detail:
**Metal Detectors:**
Metal Detectors will be posted at various points around the station and trams including manual metal detection and no-knock tram intrusions at stations for any reasons without prior warnings. At the entrance of the station will be sets of metal detectors, as well as at platform entrances and exits. The doors on the tram will contain a basic metal detector or a manual robot or human doing the metal detecting. 

During a intrusion, combatants will carry a manual metal detector to clear people. You will be required to comply to all there instructions. If you are cleared you will be able to continue the journey, however if not you will be escorted off the tram to the nearest command point of train staiton.

**Door Security:**
The doors will have a few simple security measures consisting of a door log which detetcs which personnel has gone through a door or not using an security camera or remote identification detector. Before entering a tram will be a set of glass (bullet-proof and explosion-proof) doors which require keycard activation to go through onto the tram. These doors will be locked if no tram is at the station of the tram driver does so, and shutters can be lowered between the tram and doors.

**Surveillance cameras:**
Surveillance cameras should be placed frequently in the tram stations and within the tram. A list of areas includeL
- In front and behind the train (exteriors)
- Front and back cabin areas
- A minimum of 2 in every passengar or cargo carriage
- A minimum of 2 cameras in between each carriage
- At least 3 cameras in every station and platform area
- At least 2 cameras at every blast door lock
- All command stations should have at least 5 cameras regardless of size
If a place on the TramNet is not listed, then you should have a minimum of 2 cameras or frequently place cameras. You can disregard with permission and place cameras at points of interests, entrance and exits or points of possible illegal activity and breaching. The surveillance cameras should be strategically placed in public view and disguised view.

**Blast doors:**
The blast doors consist of reinforced or heavily armored material 30 cm thick and are as wide as the tram passages. They are automatically activiated by a signal placed a few dozen metres back opening the door for a certain amount of time (just enough for the tram to pass). Each carriage has a set of signal activators, the more times the signal activiates, the longer the time the door is open foor. The signal also takes into account how frequent it is activated (detecting speed) and of course how many times (counting carriages). After the tram has surpassed the blast door, an closing signal will be placed after. It will take into account how many times the opening signal was activiated (counting carriages) and uses it to decide when to close the blast door so the tram isn't damaged or at danger. The blast door also will have a log of what tram passed, how many carriages, speed, time and date etc. Some blast door will also have more secure material, be thicker or have different opening and closing methofs such as manual opening from command stations.

## Stations
There are different types of stations.
- Standard stations: a standard station supporting up to a 10 carriage (3 metre long and maximum 7 metre wide) tram with glass safety doors and basic security
- Express stations: supports 12 carriage tram, however could fit a 20 carriage, includes multiple brakes and slightly thicker glass safety doors
- Command stations: tramnet only staff, supports only certain trains, contain SMARTrack (does not allow unauthorised trains to stop there without permissions)
- Secure stations: a station requiring prior permission to stop otherwise you will be forced to speed ahead, supports 10  carriage
- Cargo stations: only allows cargo trains to stop, 20 carriage long and passengar cannot stop without permission

## Trams
There are multiple different types of trams. They are sorted by letters indiciating what type they are then numbers to which model they are or carriages.
- X: Stands for the Xpress trains
- C: Stands for the Cargo trains.
- S: Stands for the standard trains.
- Z: Stands for secure trains.

**X Trains:**
- X1A: The standard express train, uses standard tracks only and not express only tacks (usually disguised as a standard train to trick any infiltrators)
- X1B: The standard express train but uses express only tracks as well, including faster speeds for the express only tracks
- X1C: The standard express train but it is restricted
- XC1: An express cargo train (cargo train that goes fast) specialises in lightweight cargo
- XC2: An express cargo train (cargo train that goes fast) but different design using only cargo lines and routes

**C Trains:**
- C1: Standard cargo train, can carry heavy materials and has lots of carriages
- C2: Advanced Cargo train, travels faster with heavy materials
- C3: Automatic single carriage cargo train, good for staff order and delivery
- CX: Cargo express (fast cargo train but stops every few stations)

**S Trains:**
- S1: Just a standard train, can hold as many carriages  but gets slower with more weight
- S2: Passengar train, fixed carriages and goes through any tracks

**Z trains:**
- Z-Elite: A secure train, some-what comfy/luxury inside and armored tram, usually for higher ranking personnel or standard use when commissioned
- Z-Supreme: A secure 3 carriage train with many luxuries, private use, land vehicle, ocean vehicle and air transport (can be given as a gift to good staff etc.)
- ZXpress: A secure and fast armored train, land and ocean vehicle, good for fast evacuation even through 

## Conclusion
This is the end of the TramNet document. This will be changed and edited soon and any other inquiries may be added to.
